# Data Analyst Capstone Project – In-Demand Developer Skills Analysis

This repository contains my **Data Analyst Capstone Project**, completed as part of the Coursera Data Analytics program.  
The project combines **data analysis, visualization, and storytelling** to examine global trends in developer skills using multiple data sources.

The final deliverables include:
- An **interactive Looker Studio dashboard**
- A **PowerPoint presentation** summarizing analysis, insights, and implications
